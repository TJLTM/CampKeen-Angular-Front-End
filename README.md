# CampKeen-Angular-Front-End

basic information for this is that a serial connection to campkeen from either a PI or an ESP32 will serve up the status and provide control of the device. When I have something for those projects I will provide a Link or put those within this project as that will probably need to have some FW written for teh ESP32 to work and some basic hardware schematics and build instructions to make it all work.
